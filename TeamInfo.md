## Project Summary
Taste Then Tell is a web app that will allow any university student to find reviews about the meals served in their schoolâ€™s dining halls. Students and university dining services will be able to discover what foods are a hit or miss or how dishes compare across halls. Our web app will include user authentication, search functionality, a review system, and aggregated dish ratings.
